- [Singelton](https://github.com/ElizbethK/Neoflex_Patterns/tree/main/neoflex/singleton)

Create a logging class. The method in it should output the name of the passed class and additional information. (log info: First Class, SecondClass)

- [Factory](https://github.com/ElizbethK/Neoflex_Patterns/tree/main/neoflex/factory) 

Create a coffee class, inherit two types of coffee from it, depending on what type of coffee we want, create it through the factory. (espresso, americano)

- [Adapter](https://github.com/ElizbethK/Neoflex_Patterns/tree/main/neoflex/adapter) 

The computer can only read information from USB, you need to read information from a memory card via a USB adapter. (I create a card, an adapter and read from a computer)

- [Proxy](https://github.com/ElizbethK/Neoflex_Patterns/tree/main/neoflex/proxy) 

Creating a class that stores the name of the database and "connects" to it by the full url. Connect via proxy, which adds the full address to the name. (I use the proxy to access the name of the database, I see the line connected localhost:port/db name)
